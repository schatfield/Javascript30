    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    //if you change th original variable it isn't going to update the other one
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'shawna';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);

    name = 'shawna shooshoo'
   
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    //this is actually just a reference and not a copy
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    team[3] = 'lux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update the "team" array?
    //it alters the original array "players"

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    //.slice will return the entire array if you pass it nothing
    const team2 = players.slice()


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    team4[3] = 'sally';
    //const teamGrow = team4.push('sally');

    //console.log(teamGrow);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //this is just creating a refercne and will change your original object
    //you just made a new object and updated the original at the saem time here
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    //Variable, Object.assign, empty object, object you want to copy, properties you want to change
   const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 79, age:12});


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
